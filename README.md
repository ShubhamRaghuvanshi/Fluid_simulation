# Fluid_simulation
The code can Numerically solve of two dimentional Navier-Stokes fluid equations for compressible and incompressible flows using 
pressure corrector, and voritcity stream function approach. Some attached examples are
(1) Cavity flow.
(2) Laminar Flow inside Pipe.
(3) Two dimentional turbulent flow.
